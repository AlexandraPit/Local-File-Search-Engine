The main purpose of discounts is convincing people to buy something they wouldn’t otherwise
Discounts have always represented a highly controversial issue. In the last years, this topic gained popularity and it is thoroughly debatable nowadays whether these sales are in our favour or are just made to manipulate the buyer.
On one hand, there are types of discounts that are only made for the seller’s advantage. Most of the time, sellers trick us into thinking that we will save a lot of money when we see a huge discount. In reality, the seller increased the initial price far more than what the product was worth, then lowered the price to the value that was supposed to be sold for from the beginning. This method is used so often and it still tricks people into buying stuff they don’t even need.
On the other hand, we can also stumble upon favourable discounts. For example, there are food sales for products with short shelf life. This situation brings real discounts, with no tricks. You may wonder why would the seller lower the price beneath its actual worth. It is easy to see the answer to this question:  If the products expire, the seller will be forced to throw away all those aliments. This way, not only he won’t get any profit, but he will also be at loss, as he invested money in the production. To avoid this, he lowers the prices to sell as much of the remaining products as they can. As a buyer, it is advantageous if you already needed to buy food, you will pay less and the short term won’t bother you if you consume it before the specified date. These types of discounts are advantageous for the buyers, for the seller, and also for the environment, as there will be less waste of food.
All things concluded, I believe the main purpose of most discounts is convincing people to buy something they wouldn’t otherwise, but this is not valid for all cases, as there are sales that are made simply to help us.
